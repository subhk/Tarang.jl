# Temporal Filters for Lagrangian Averaging

This module provides temporal filters for computing Lagrangian means in fluid dynamics,
enabling efficient wave-mean flow decomposition. Based on the paper:

    Minz, Baker, Kafiabad, Vanneste (2025) "Efficient Lagrangian averaging with
    exponential filters", Phys. Rev. Fluids 10, 074902.

## Quick Start

```julia
# Create a Butterworth filter (sharper rolloff than exponential)
filter = ButterworthFilter((Nx, Ny); α=0.1)  # α = 1/averaging_time

# Precompute ETD coefficients for unconditional stability
coeffs = precompute_etd_coefficients(filter, dt)

# In time loop:
for step in 1:nsteps
    # ... your PDE timestepping ...
    update_etd!(filter, field, coeffs)  # No stability limit!
end

# Get filtered mean
mean_field = get_mean(filter)
```

## Time Integration Methods

| Method | Stability | Use Case |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| `update!(filter, h, dt)` | dt ≤ √2/α | Simple, small α·dt |
| `update!(filter, h, dt, Val(:RK2))` | dt ≤ 2/α (exp), dt ≈ 2.18/α (butterworth) | Moderate α·dt |
| `update_etd!(filter, h, coeffs)` | **Unconditional** | Recommended |
| `update_imex!(filter, h_hist, coeffs)` | **Unconditional** | SBDF solvers |

## 1. What is Wave-Mean Flow Interaction?

In fluid dynamics, flows often contain both **slow mean motions** and **fast oscillations**
(like waves). Examples include:
- Ocean: slow currents + fast internal gravity waves
- Atmosphere: jet streams + fast gravity waves
- Plasma: bulk flows + fast Alfvén waves

To understand and model these systems, we need to **separate the mean flow from the waves**.
This separation is called "wave-mean flow decomposition".

## 2. Why Lagrangian Averaging?

There are two ways to define "mean":

### Eulerian Mean (fixed point in space)
Average the field at a fixed location over time:
```
    ū_Eulerian(x) = ⟨u(x, t)⟩_time
```
Problem: This captures wave oscillations passing by, not the actual material transport.

### Lagrangian Mean (following fluid parcels)
Average following the motion of fluid particles:
```
    ū_Lagrangian = ⟨u along particle trajectory⟩
```
This captures the **actual transport** of material (heat, salt, pollutants).

**The Lagrangian mean is more physically meaningful** for transport and mixing,
but traditionally harder to compute.

## 3. The Key Insight: Exponential Time Filters

Instead of computing trajectories explicitly, we use **temporal filters** that
preferentially average over a timescale 1/α, where α is the **inverse averaging time**.

### First-Order Exponential Filter

The simplest filter uses an exponentially decaying kernel:

```
                    ∞
    h̄(t) = α ∫₀  exp(-ατ) h(t-τ) dτ
```

This weighs recent values more heavily than old values. The decay rate α determines
how far back in time we average:
- Large α → short averaging window (less filtering)
- Small α → long averaging window (more filtering)

**In the frequency domain**, this filter has transfer function:
```
    H(ω) = α / (α + iω)
```

The **power response** |H(ω)|² shows how much each frequency is preserved:
```
    |H(ω)|² = α² / (α² + ω²)
```

At frequency ω = α, the signal is reduced to 50% power (the "cutoff frequency").
High frequencies ω >> α are strongly attenuated.

### Evolution Equation (How to Compute)

Rather than computing the integral directly, we evolve h̄ via the ODE:
```
    dh̄/dt = α(h - h̄)
```

This is simply **relaxation toward the current value** with rate α.
- If h > h̄: the mean increases toward h
- If h < h̄: the mean decreases toward h
- Steady state (h = const): h̄ → h

## 4. Second-Order Butterworth Filter

The exponential filter has a gradual frequency rolloff (-20 dB/decade in engineering
terms). For better separation of waves from mean flow, we want a **sharper cutoff**.

The **second-order Butterworth filter** provides a "maximally flat" frequency response:
- Flat passband (low frequencies pass through unchanged)
- Sharp transition at the cutoff frequency
- Steep rolloff (-40 dB/decade, twice as fast as exponential)

### Transfer Function

In the Laplace domain (s = iω):
```
    K(s) = α² / (s² + √2·α·s + α²)
```

### Time Domain Kernel

The impulse response (filter kernel) is:
```
    k(t) = √2·α·exp(-αt/√2)·sin(αt/√2)·Θ(t)
```

where Θ(t) is the Heaviside step function (zero for t<0, one for t>0).

This kernel:
1. Rises from zero (unlike exponential which starts at maximum)
2. Peaks around t ≈ 1/α
3. Decays exponentially
4. Has **oscillating** character (the sine term)

### Coupled Evolution Equations

The Butterworth filter requires **two coupled variables**: h̄ (mean) and h̃ (auxiliary).

From the transfer function, we derive (see paper Eq. 24-30):
```
    dh̃/dt = α[h - (√2-1)h̃ - (2-√2)h̄]
    dh̄/dt = α(h̃ - h̄)
```

Or in matrix form:
```
    d/dt [h̃]   = -α·A [h̃]   + α [h]
         [h̄]         [h̄]       [0]

    where A = [√2-1    2-√2 ]  ≈ [0.414  0.586]
              [ -1       1  ]    [-1.000  1.000]
```

The **eigenvalues** of A are complex: λ = (√2 ± i√2)/2
This explains the oscillating kernel behavior.

## 5. Frequency Response Comparison

```
         Frequency Response |H(ω)|²

    1.0 |--________
        |          ----____
        |                  ----____   Exponential: -20 dB/decade
    0.5 |       X                  ----____
        |                                   ----___
        |                                          ----
        |                 ----____                     Butterworth: -40 dB/decade
    0.0 |________________________----____________________
        0       α       2α       5α       10α      ω →
                ↑
           cutoff frequency

    At ω = α:   Exponential |H|² = 0.50  (50% power)
                Butterworth |H|² = 0.50  (50% power)

    At ω = 10α: Exponential |H|² = 0.0099 (1% power)
                Butterworth |H|² = 0.0001 (0.01% power)
```

The Butterworth filter attenuates high frequencies **100× more** than exponential
at 10× the cutoff frequency!

## 6. Lagrangian Averaging with the Lifting Map

For **Lagrangian** (as opposed to Eulerian) averaging, we need to track fluid parcel
positions. The key concept is the **lifting map** Ξ(x,t):

```
    Ξ(x,t) = position at time t of the parcel whose MEAN position is x
```

The **displacement field** ξ is the periodic part:
```
    ξ(x,t) = Ξ(x,t) - x
```

### Mean Velocity Relations

For **exponential mean**:
```
    ū = α·ξ
```
The mean velocity is proportional to the displacement.

For **Butterworth filter**:
```
    ū = α·ξ̃     (the auxiliary displacement)
    ũ = α·[ξ - (√2-1)·ξ̃]
```

### Displacement Evolution

The displacement evolves according to:
```
    ∂ξ/∂t + ū·∇ξ = u∘(id + ξ) - ū
```

where u∘(id + ξ) means "velocity evaluated at displaced position x + ξ".

For the Butterworth case, we also need:
```
    ∂ξ̃/∂t + ū·∇ξ̃ = ũ - ū
```

### Lagrangian Mean of Scalars

To compute the Lagrangian mean of a scalar field g (temperature, salinity, etc.):

For **exponential mean**:
```
    ∂gᴸ/∂t + ū·∇gᴸ = α(g∘Ξ - gᴸ)
```

For **Butterworth** (two equations):
```
    ∂g̃/∂t + ū·∇g̃ = α[g∘Ξ - (√2-1)g̃ - (2-√2)gᴸ]
    ∂gᴸ/∂t + ū·∇gᴸ = α(g̃ - gᴸ)
```

## 7. Choosing the Parameter α

The **inverse averaging timescale** α is the key user parameter:

- **α = 1/T** where T is the averaging time window
- Choose **T >> T_wave** (period of waves to filter out)
- Typically: T ≈ 10-100 × T_wave

For example, if filtering internal waves with period 1 hour:
- T = 10 hours → α = 0.1 per hour
- This filters oscillations faster than ~10 hours

**Rule of thumb**: For good wave-mean separation, the Butterworth filter
effectively filters waves with ω ≳ 20α (see Minz et al. 2025, Fig. 3).

## 8. Computational Cost

| Filter        | Memory per field | Compute per step | Accuracy       |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Exponential   | 1 array (h̄)      | 1 update         | Good           |
| Butterworth   | 2 arrays (h̄, h̃)  | 2 coupled ODEs   | Excellent      |
| Lagrangian    | 2-4 arrays       | Displacement PDE | Best (physics) |

The Butterworth filter provides significantly better filtering for modest
additional computational cost.

## 9. Quick Start Example

```julia
using Tarang

# Create a Butterworth filter for 2D fields
Nx, Ny = 64, 64
α = 0.5  # inverse averaging time
filter = ButterworthFilter((Nx, Ny); α=α)

# In your time loop:
for step in 1:nsteps
    # ... compute field h ...

    # Update filter with current field values
    update!(filter, h, dt)

    # Access the filtered mean
    h_mean = get_mean(filter)

    # Fluctuation is the remainder
    h_prime = h - h_mean
end
```

For full Lagrangian averaging with displacement tracking:

```julia
# Create Lagrangian filter
lag_filter = LagrangianFilter((Nx, Ny); α=0.5, filter_type=:butterworth)

# In time loop, provide velocity field
for step in 1:nsteps
    update_displacement!(lag_filter, velocity, dt)

    # Get mean velocity
    ū = get_mean_velocity(lag_filter)
end
```
